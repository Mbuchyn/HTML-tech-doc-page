          <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements, which tell the web browser how to display the content. <p>Other languages, such as CSS and JavaScript, are used alongside HTML to create and modify a webpage's appearance and functionality. CSS and JavaScript make webpages look good while being interactive.</p>
          <p>"Hypertext", at it's essence, is simply text that links to other text. It often incluedes images, and it is intentionally organized to connect to other items. It makes the WorldWideWeb a web!</p>

          <p>Physicist Tim Berners-Lee first proposed what would become HTML in 1989, as a way for researchers to conveniently share documents on the internet. It was created in 1991, and based on the <br>already-internationally agreed upon SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up Language), with HTML 1.0 being released in 1993.</p>
          <p>Berners-Lee continued to work on and refine HTML, with HTML 2.0 being released in 1995. It retained the core of 1.0, but with added features, and took into account suggestions from the programming community.</p>
          <p>The next two HTML versions and updates came much closer together. HTML 3.2 was released in early 1997, with version 4.0 less than a year later. <br>We then saw no updates for years, as the programming world began focusing on XML. XML works alongside HTML, and focuses on <em>transferring</em> information, rather than the presentation of that information.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the current version of HTML, version 5.0, was released, with a major update in 2014. In included updates to make the internet what we think of it as today, with essential tags such as <code>&lt;video></code> and <code>&lt;audio></code>, as well as updated page structure elements for common page formatting like <code>&lt;header></code> and <code>&lt;footer></code>.

          <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag. It looks something like this <br> <code> &lt;tagname>content of some sort...&lt;/tagname></code>. The HTML <strong>element</strong> is everything from the start tag to the end tag: <code>&lt;h1>Hello,world!&lt;/h1></code>.</p>
          <h4>Some basic HTML elements:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;head></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;title></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;body></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;header></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;article></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;section></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;div></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;p></code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;img></code></li>
